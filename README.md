# RomCom

## Description
This is a webpage that generates romance novel covers.

## Usage
When the page loads, you will see a randomly generated romance novel cover. Click the “Show New Random Cover” button to generate a new cover. If you like a cover, click the “Save Cover” button to add it to the saved section.

To view all saved covers, click the “View Saved Covers” button. This will take you to a new page that displays all of your saved covers. To remove a cover from the saved section, double click that cover. From here, you can go back to the home page using the “Home” button, or create your own cover using the “Make Your Own Cover” button. 

To create your own cover, click the “Make Your Own Cover” button. This will take you to a new page where you are able to enter your own cover photo, title, and descriptors. Once you have entered all four inputs, click the “Make my book” button. This will take you back to the home page and your new cover will be displayed. You can also use the “Home” button to return to the home page and view the most recently generated cover.
